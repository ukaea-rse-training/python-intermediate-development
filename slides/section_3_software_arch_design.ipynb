    "- This section is going to be a bit of theory before we get back to more concrete programming, but it is important to have a conceptual view of the options available to us when solving problems, because the language we choose will have an influence upon this.\n",
    "- Different languages apply different programming paradigms, which give us different tools for how we can structure and design our code.\n",
    "- The primary divide is between _Imperative_ and _Declarative_ languages\n",
    "- Poll the learners with stickies or Zoom reactions with the question: \"Have you heard the terms _paradigm_, _declarative_, and _imperative_ before in relation to programming?\"\n",
    "  - If a large number have, then ask the follow up: \"Do you have a good grasp of the meaning of these terms and the practical differences between imperative and declarative programming?\"\n",
    "  - If the majority answer in the affirmative, it is fine to skip to the FizzBuzz exercise\n",
    "  - Otherwise, give a brief description of imperative vs declarative, and then get the group to read through the section.\n",
    "- Imperative: grammatically, an imperative statement is an order or instruction\n",
    "  - e.g. \"get me a soda\", \"got to the shop\", \"do this important task\"\n",
    "  - this can readily be applied to our relationship to a computer through a programming language, in which we give it instructions\n",
    "  - e.g. \"for all the elements in this list, add the value of each to this sum\", \"if the value is greater than 10, add it to the sum\", etc.\n",
    "  - This is likely the paradigm of programming we are all most familiar with\n",
    "- Declarative: grammatically, a declarative sentence is a statement of fact or opinion. It is a description.\n",
    "  - e.g. \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", \"I don't understand functional programming\"\n",
    "  - it is less obvious how this can be used when interacting with computers\n",
    "  - The idea of applying a declarative paradigm in programming is that we describe _what_ we want the program to do, rather than _how_ it should do it\n",
    "  - implementation details (i.e. the _how_) are left to lower level features of the language\n",
    "  - if anyone has every used a query language like SQL before, this will make a lot more sense\n",
    "- It is worth a note that Python is a multi-paradigm language\n",
    "  - it borrows elements from OO, functional, and procedural paradigms\n",
    "  - you can write programs that are a mix of these paradigms, or more strictly stick to one, it is up to you (which can be both a good and bad thing)\n",
    "  - more likely, you will write something where Python objects (so OO) are treated like data which is processed in a functional style\n",
