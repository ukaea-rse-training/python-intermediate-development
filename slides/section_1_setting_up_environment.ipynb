    "  - talk through the image\n",
    "  - the best practice is to use a new branch for each separate and self-contained unit/piece of work you want to add to the project. This unit of work is also often called a feature and the branch where you develop it is called a feature branch. Each feature branch should have its own meaningful name - indicating its purpose (e.g. “issue23-fix”). If we keep making changes and pushing them directly to main branch on GitHub, then anyone who downloads our software from there will get all of our work in progress - whether or not it’s ready to use! So, working on a separate branch for each feature you are adding is good for several reasons:\n",
    "    - it enables the main branch to remain stable while you and the team explore and test the new code on a feature branch,\n",
    "    - it enables you to keep the untested and not-yet-functional feature branch code under version control and backed up,\n",
    "    - you and other team members may work on several features at the same time independently from one another,\n",
    "    - if you decide that the feature is not working or is no longer needed - you can easily and safely discard that branch without affecting the rest of the code.\n",
    "- Something missing from this section is a mention that a multi-person project, even if not external facing or with no users other than the developers, should have some record or agreement of how branching will work, and some document telling potential contributors how they can submit contributions through pull requests, usually in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.\n",
